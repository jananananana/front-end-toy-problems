Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the multiple of the rest of the numbers in the array except the one at the current index.

For example [1,2,3] would return [6,3,2].
multiplyNumbers([0,9,1,3]) should return [27,0,0,0].
multiplyNumbers([1,2,6,5]) should return [60, 30, 10, 12].
